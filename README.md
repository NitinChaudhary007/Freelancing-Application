## Technical Architecture

The technical architecture follows a client-server model, where the frontend serves as the client and the backend acts as the server. The frontend encompasses the user interface, presentation, and integrates the Axios library to facilitate easy communication with the backend through RESTful APIs.

To enhance the user experience, the frontend leverages the Bootstrap and Material UI libraries, creating a real-time and visually appealing interface for users.

On the backend, we utilize the Express Js framework to manage server-side logic and communication. Express Js provides a robust foundation for handling requests and responses efficiently.

For data storage and retrieval, we rely on MongoDB. MongoDB offers a scalable and efficient solution for storing various data, ensuring quick and reliable access.

In conjunction, the frontend and backend components form a comprehensive technical architecture, ensuring smooth and immersive experiences for users.
